## ðŸ“„ Assignment Tasks

1. **Reduce the number of intensity levels** in a grayscale image from 256 to 2, in integer powers of 2.  
   - The desired number of intensity levels should be a variable input to the program.

2. **Perform spatial averaging** using a 3Ã—3 neighborhood.  
   - Repeat the process for 10Ã—10 and 20Ã—20 neighborhoods.

3. **Rotate an image** by **45Â°** and **90Â°**.

4. **Blockwise averaging**: For every 3Ã—3 block (non-overlapping), replace the block with the average value.  
   - Repeat for 5Ã—5 and 7Ã—7 blocks.
